# Octocat 3D

I was looking for something easy to print after my last project ([the Scorpitron!](http://lorennorman.github.com/scorpion-bot)), and I thought the Octocat would be cute. It was harder than expected, but I've got a passable version 1 knocked together. I'll paint it up if the rain ever lets up :/
